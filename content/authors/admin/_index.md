I'm a trained environmental engineer, urban planner, environmental public health professional, and social scientist. I have spent a freew-wheeling academic and professional career working with data characterizing many aspects of water, the natural and built environments, and people. In doing so, I haved addressed a wide range of pressing policy questions, ranging from local land use decisions to international infrastructure finance.

On this page, you'll find  information about various academic, professional, and hobby projects. This website is also home to my blog, "[Kyle OnWater](https://www.kyleonda.com/post/)", where I opine on various water, data, and urban policy issues; provide tutorials on data science or data architecture related to water; and discuss news and other items concerning water, the environment, cities, and infrastructure.  

I'm currently the Data Architect for the [Internet of Water](https://internetofwater.org) project of the [Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions](https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu), where I develop standards, best practices, and templates for the storage, publishing, and cataloging of water-related data. In this role, I also educate agencies that produce water data in ways to make water data discoverable, accessible, and interoperable by adopting (meta)data standards, data exchange standards, API standards, as well as leveraging open-source software and public cloud services. I am also a statistician for [Valor Water Analytics](https://valorwater.com), where I apply econometric methods and quasi-experimental research designs to customer-level water meter data to help utilities understand how their customers react to prices, information, and weather.
