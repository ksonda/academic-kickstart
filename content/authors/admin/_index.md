I'm a trained environmental engineer, urban planner, environmental public health professional, and social scientist who has spent a 12-year academic and professional career working with data characterizing many aspects of water, the natural and built environments, and people. In doing so, I haved addressed a wide range of pressing policy questions at scales ranging from local land use decisions to international infrastructure finance.

I'm currently the Data Architect for the [Internet of Water](https://internetofwater.org) project of the [Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions](https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu), where I develop standards, best practices, and templates for the storage, publishing, and cataloging of water-related data, as well as help educate water-producing agencies in ways to make water data discoverable, accessible, and interoperable. I am also a statistician for [Valor Water Analytics](https://valorwater.com), where I apply econometric methods and quasi-experimental research designs to customer-level water meter data to help utilities understand how their customers react to prices, information, and weather.
